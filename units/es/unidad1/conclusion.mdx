# Conclusion [[conclusion]]

Congrats on finishing this unit! **That was the biggest one**, and there was a lot of information. And congrats on finishing the tutorial. Youâ€™ve just trained your first Deep RL agents and shared them with the community! ðŸ¥³

It's **normal if you still feel confused by some of these elements**. This was the same for me and for all people who studied RL.

**Take time to really grasp the material** before continuing. Itâ€™s important to master these elements and have a solid foundation before entering the fun part.

Naturally, during the course, weâ€™re going to use and explain these terms again, but itâ€™s better to understand them before diving into the next units.

In the next (bonus) unit, weâ€™re going to reinforce what we just learned by **training Huggy the Dog to fetch a stick**.

You will then be able to play with him ðŸ¤—.

Finally, we would love **to hear what you think of the course and how we can improve it**. If you have some feedback then, please ðŸ‘‰  [fill this form](https://forms.gle/BzKXWzLAGZESGNaE9)

### Keep Learning, stay awesome ðŸ¤—
